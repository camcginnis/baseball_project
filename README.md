This was the website I built.  I built it with my love of baseball sabermetrics in mind and as my inspiration.

One serious challenge I encountered limited my ability to achieve my ultimate goal. Unfortunately, the only way I could pull the data was to pay more than $600.00 per month. Ultimately, I input data into the site to ensure that it was functional.
